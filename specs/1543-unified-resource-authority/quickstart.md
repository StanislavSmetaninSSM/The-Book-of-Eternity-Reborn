# Quickstart: Unified Resource Authority

## 1. Purpose

This guide is the executable validation handoff for [#1543](https://github.com/StanislavSmetaninSSM/The-Book-of-Eternity-Reborn/issues/1543) and the resumed resource-dependent Effect Task 9 in [#1535](https://github.com/StanislavSmetaninSSM/The-Book-of-Eternity-Reborn/issues/1535). It proves the final single-authority cutover; it is not a migration guide.

## 2. Preconditions

- Work only in the isolated `E:/Games/worktrees/boe-1535-effect-materialization` worktree.
- Read `AGENTS.md`, `.specify/memory/constitution.md`, this feature's `spec.md`, `plan.md`, `research.md`, `data-model.md`, every `contracts/*.md`, and the approved Superpowers design.
- Confirm GitHub issues #1543 and #1535 remain open and #1535 records the #1543 blocker.
- Confirm `git status --short --branch` contains only the active feature's expected work.
- Use PowerShell 7 and `scripts/test-csharp.ps1`; never run an unbounded full-solution `dotnet test` and never enable or invoke GitHub Actions.
- Read `docs/testing.md` before choosing a lane.

### Phase-1 baseline evidence (2026-08-15)

- Issues: #1543 `OPEN`; #1535 `OPEN` and explicitly blocked by #1543 for Effect Task 9.
- Workspace: branch `1535-effect-materialization`; root `E:/Games/worktrees/boe-1535-effect-materialization`; clean before implementation.
- Command: `pwsh -NoProfile -File .\scripts\test-csharp.ps1 -Lane Fast`.
- Result: exit `0`; timeout `false`; `3479/3479` executed and passed; failures `0`; duplicate test IDs `0`; owned-tree cleanup `complete`; wall `00:04:02.3268448`.
- Summary: `TestResults/test-lanes/20260815-152211-507-33852-278bd0d07af7444aaa060a26783f082c-fast/summary.json`.
- Harness RED 1: `TestResults/test-lanes/20260815-153733-515-18216-f163ecfa317c4cf2a846976d0654ff8f-focused/summary.json`; expected build failure because `ResourceMaterializationTestContext` did not exist.
- Harness RED 2: `TestResults/test-lanes/20260815-153846-219-17504-c9674d2b64a04d999064e487ad9f804e-focused/summary.json`; expected build failure after the strict-root assertion was added and before the harness existed.
- Harness GREEN (final Task-1 snapshot): `TestResults/test-lanes/20260815-154703-722-41500-00f376b0b55348318972aaa262945bce-focused/summary.json`; exit `0`; timeout `false`; `6/6` executed and passed; failures `0`; duplicate test IDs `0`; owned-tree cleanup `complete`; wall `00:00:15.8617710`.
- GitHub Actions were neither enabled nor invoked.

## 3. Canonical example state

The active new-game example must contain:

```text
game_state/resources/resource_definitions.json
game_state/resources/resource_state.json
game_state/resources/resource_history.json
```

It must not contain persisted mechanical values in the removed player, NPC, vehicle, combat, item, or afterlife fields. `resource_commands.json` is absent outside an accepted staged turn.

Minimum built-in examples:

- Mortal `player_current`: health, energy, poise;
- one named NPC health owner;
- one anonymous combatant and one stable group member;
- one vehicle health owner bound to permanent `vehicleId`;
- one item with durability and one with charges/ammunition;
- one afterlife spiritual-action-points owner;
- one Guardian/Shining per-return charge owner;
- one setting-defined resource materialization example;
- empty immutable history at bootstrap with valid creation chronology in state.

## 4. Contract and reducer RED/GREEN

Run after the contract, definition/state/history, owner authority, and reducer tasks:

```powershell
pwsh -NoProfile -File .\scripts\test-csharp.ps1 -Lane Focused -Filter "FullyQualifiedName~ResourceMaterializationContractTests|FullyQualifiedName~ResourceDefinitionCatalogTests|FullyQualifiedName~ResourceStateContractTests|FullyQualifiedName~ResourceHistoryStateTests|FullyQualifiedName~ResourceOwnerAuthorityTests|FullyQualifiedName~ResourceMutationReducerTests"
```

Expected:

- all tests pass;
- duplicate/confusable/unknown/wrong-root/empty/null/legacy cases fail closed;
- integer, decimal, quantum, min/max, clamp/reject, overflow, exact ratio, order, replay, and conflicting replay cases are covered;
- no test process survives lane cleanup.

## 5. Accepted mechanics plan RED/GREEN

```powershell
pwsh -NoProfile -File .\scripts\test-csharp.ps1 -Lane Focused -Filter "FullyQualifiedName~AcceptedMechanicsPlannerTests|FullyQualifiedName~AcceptedMechanicsPlanCacheTests|FullyQualifiedName~ResourceTriggerGraphTests|FullyQualifiedName~ResourcePendingResolutionTests"
```

Expected:

- one plan instance and one random identity set are reused from validation through publication;
- all four phases and stable within-phase ordering pass;
- cycles, missing dependencies, 1,025th node, depth 33, stale fingerprints, late literal-null/malformed changes, and cache reuse after consumption fail with zero writes;
- deterministic mutations never create pending work;
- bounded no-state-change/resource-delta receipts are exact and replay-safe.

## 6. Owner lifecycle RED/GREEN

```powershell
pwsh -NoProfile -File .\scripts\test-csharp.ps1 -Lane Focused -FocusedProject Integration -Filter "FullyQualifiedName~ResourceOwnerMaterializationTests|FullyQualifiedName~ResourceCombatOwnerTests|FullyQualifiedName~ResourceVehicleOwnerTests|FullyQualifiedName~ResourceItemOwnerTests|FullyQualifiedName~ResourceAfterlifeOwnerTests"
```

Expected:

- player, named NPC, anonymous combatant, group member, vehicle, item, persistent afterlife actor, conflict side, and afterlife scope resolve exact owners;
- named NPC combat entry uses the same owner;
- every accepted `combatantRef`/`memberRef` is consumed even without a resource/effect command;
- item movement preserves the coordinate;
- vehicle activation/parking/movement preserves the coordinate and destruction retires it;
- member/item/conflict terminal transitions leave history and no orphan live state;
- case/confusable/historical/cross-realm/unknown bindings fail atomically.

## 7. Mortal ordinary-operation cutover

```powershell
pwsh -NoProfile -File .\scripts\test-csharp.ps1 -Lane Focused -FocusedProject Integration -Filter "FullyQualifiedName~MortalResourceCutoverTests|FullyQualifiedName~ResourceCombatIntegrationTests|FullyQualifiedName~ResourceVehicleIntegrationTests|FullyQualifiedName~ResourceItemIntegrationTests|FullyQualifiedName~MortalBootstrapValidationTests"
```

Expected:

- ordinary damage, healing, energy spend/gain, poise damage/restore, vehicle damage/restore, and item use/repair/fire/reload use the reducer;
- legacy player delta, NPC/vehicle/combat health, group health array, durability, and item resource commands are rejected;
- no persisted legacy mirror remains after bootstrap or a turn;
- one invalid sibling produces zero resource/owner/effect/output writes.

## 8. Afterlife cutover

```powershell
pwsh -NoProfile -File .\scripts\test-csharp.ps1 -Lane Focused -FocusedProject Integration -Filter "FullyQualifiedName~AfterlifeResourceCutoverTests|FullyQualifiedName~AfterlifeSpiritualConflictValidationTests|FullyQualifiedName~GuardianGachaResourceTests|FullyQualifiedName~ShiningGachaResourceTests|FullyQualifiedName~ShiningBlessingResourceTests"
```

Expected:

- action-point cost/recovery, per-return gacha consumption/reset, and numeric blessing reroll use common state/history;
- registered capacity formulas reproduce existing spirit-focus/reputation/return-cycle rules;
- currencies, progression, relationships, faction ledgers, and spiritual axes remain unchanged in their owning systems;
- conflict/return-cycle closure retires only scoped resources.

## 9. Effect Task 9 integration

```powershell
pwsh -NoProfile -File .\scripts\test-csharp.ps1 -Lane Focused -Filter "FullyQualifiedName~EffectResourceTriggerPlannerTests|FullyQualifiedName~EffectLifecycleSchedulerTests|FullyQualifiedName~ResourceTriggerGraphTests"
pwsh -NoProfile -File .\scripts\test-csharp.ps1 -Lane Focused -FocusedProject Integration -Filter "FullyQualifiedName~EffectResourceMaterializationTests|FullyQualifiedName~CanonicalStateNormalizerEffectTests|FullyQualifiedName~ResourcePendingResolutionIntegrationTests"
```

Expected:

- ordinary and effect-equivalent mutations produce the same state/history semantics;
- periodic damage/restore, depletion/fill triggers, nested downstream mutations, stack/lifetime advancement, terminal cleanup, and replay use one plan;
- story-facing pending requests change no mechanics until a valid receipt/full-turn resubmission;
- no effect-only resource field adapter exists.

## 10. Projection, privacy, and parity

```powershell
pwsh -NoProfile -File .\scripts\test-csharp.ps1 -Lane Focused -Filter "FullyQualifiedName~ResourceProjectionServiceTests|FullyQualifiedName~ResourcePlayerPrivacyTests|FullyQualifiedName~BrowserApiContractTests"
pwsh -NoProfile -File .\scripts\test-csharp.ps1 -Lane Focused -FocusedProject Integration -Filter "FullyQualifiedName~ResourceConsoleBrowserParityTests|FullyQualifiedName~ExplorerModeCommandTests|FullyQualifiedName~ExplorerWebCommandServiceTests"
```

Expected:

- console/browser expose equivalent visible facts/actions;
- hidden and GM-only entries produce no player row/count/delta/action/implication;
- malformed/missing safe projection never falls back to legacy raw state;
- recursive DTO scans find no owner/transition/event/receipt/fingerprint/path/validation/repair/agent data.

Manual spot-check after automated parity is green:

1. Start one fresh technical game from the active template.
2. Compare status bar, `/status`, browser game screen, one NPC detail, one combatant detail, one item detail, and one afterlife conflict/charge view.
3. Confirm all copy is in-world Russian and no IDs, paths, JSON/API/DTO language, repair guidance, or hidden values appear.

## 11. Atomic publication and rollback

```powershell
pwsh -NoProfile -File .\scripts\test-csharp.ps1 -Lane LifecycleIntegration
```

Expected:

- injected failure after every resource definition/state/history, owner companion, effect carrier/index, pending, command deletion, and output write restores exact bytes/prior absence;
- post-validation failure restores all paths and suppresses stale narration/interface output;
- protected failures dispatch no actionable GM repair;
- one bounded GM-owned omission requires coherent full-turn resubmission.

## 12. Documentation, examples, and active template

```powershell
pwsh -NoProfile -File .\scripts\test-csharp.ps1 -Lane Focused -Filter "FullyQualifiedName~PromptDocumentationCoverageTests|FullyQualifiedName~AfterlifeDocumentationCoverageTests|FullyQualifiedName~ResourceContractSourceGuardTests"
pwsh -NoProfile -File .\scripts\test-csharp.ps1 -Lane Focused -FocusedProject Integration -Filter "FullyQualifiedName~ExampleDocumentationValidationTests|FullyQualifiedName~FileSystemExampleFixtureIntegrityTests"
pwsh -NoProfile -File .\scripts\test-csharp.ps1 -Lane FullValidation
```

Expected:

- Mortal and afterlife prompts/docs/examples/manifests describe only the new command/owner/projection rules;
- at least one worked Mortal and one worked afterlife response validate in production;
- active template/fixtures contain complete canonical resource roots and no removed authority fields;
- historical docs may mention removed fields only through an explicit source-guard allow-list.

## 13. Performance and meaningful control

```powershell
pwsh -NoProfile -File .\scripts\test-csharp.ps1 -Lane Focused -Filter "FullyQualifiedName~ResourceAuthorityScaleTests|FullyQualifiedName~AcceptedMechanicsPlannerScaleTests"
pwsh -NoProfile -File .\scripts\test-csharp.ps1 -Lane Fast
```

Expected:

- doubling representative definitions/owners/state/history/mutations/triggers remains at or below 2.5x measured work;
- Fast passes with zero failures, duplicates, timeout, or leaked processes.

Record summary paths and elapsed times in the Superpowers implementation plan. Do not run another Fast immediately before PreMerge.

## 14. Final merge gate

Run only after every #1543 slice and resumed #1535 resource-dependent task is complete, docs/examples are synchronized, the legacy source guard is clean, and the diff has been reviewed:

```powershell
git diff --check
pwsh -NoProfile -File .\scripts\test-csharp.ps1 -Lane PreMerge
```

Expected:

- `git diff --check` has no errors;
- PreMerge exits `0`, times out `false`, all completed tests pass, duplicate count is `0`, and cleanup is complete;
- no GitHub Actions are enabled or invoked;
- no compatibility reader, migration, dual-write, raw fallback, or second persisted resource authority remains.
